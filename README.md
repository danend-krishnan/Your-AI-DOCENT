# Your-AI-DOCENT
OVERVIEW
YOUR AI DOCENT is an AI powered application designed to automatically translates videos to multiple languages . This application extracts audio from a selected video file, transcribes the audio using the Vosk speech recognition engine, translates the transcription into a user-selected language using Google Translate, and then generates a new video file with the translated audio using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech). User friendly interface of this application makes the workflow much easier.

FEATURES
YOUR AI DOCENT-is built using Python and features a user-friendly interface developed with Tkinter. The application employs Vosk for speech recognition, the Google Translate API for translation, and GTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for generating translated audio. MoviePy is used for video editing, and Matplotlib provides real-time graph updates during the process.

USAGE
YOUR AI DOCENT is a powerful tool that streamlines the process of translating and dubbing videos into various languages, making it an invaluable asset for diverse applications. ED-TECH companies can leverage this tool to deliver courses to students across different regions, ensuring that high-quality educational content is accessible regardless of language barriers. Content creators can use the application to produce and release their videos in multiple regional languages, reaching a wider audience. Additionally, individuals can easily translate foreign-language videos into their own regional languages, enhancing understanding and engagement. With the rapid growth of the media industry and the rise of ed-tech platforms, the internet is filled with educational content that is often only available in foreign languages. This poses a significant challenge for students in remote areas who may struggle to benefit from these resources. YOUR AI DOCENT solves this problem by using AI technologies like speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech conversion to automate the video dubbing process, making it easier to access and understand content in any language.
